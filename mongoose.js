/**
 * Notes on behavior:
 * 
 * If a schema while adding data to MongoDB has lesser data than defined in the schema, it will still add it.
 * 
 * Example 1: 
 * const newData = new UserModel({
 *     name: "John Cena",
 *     age: 58,
 * });
 * 
 * This will be added even if it has no "email" field.
 * Data for "name" and "age" will be added.
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * const newData = new UserModel({
 *     name: "John Mcarthy",
 *     age: 50,
 *     email: "mcarthy@yahoomail.com",
 *     rollNO: 101,
 * });
 * 
 * In this case, "rollNO" will not be added because itâ€™s not defined in the schema.
 * Only "name", "age", and "email" fields will be stored as per the schema.

/**
 * Summary:
 * This file demonstrates how to connect to MongoDB using Mongoose and perform basic data insertion.
 * 
 * - A "UserSchema" is defined to enforce structure and validation on the "users" collection.
 * - The `connectUsingMongoose` function connects to a MongoDB instance and saves a new user document.
 * - It also demonstrates how Mongoose handles schema mismatches: extra fields (like `rollNO`) not defined in the schema are ignored.
 * 
 * This setup ensures data integrity while allowing flexible schema enforcement when inserting documents.
